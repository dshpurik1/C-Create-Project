# C-Create-Project

A basic Tic-Tac-Toe game between two players using SFML graphics, functions, classes, and file I/O in C++.

This Tic-Tac-Toe game allows for two people to play against each other for as many times as they want
and to beat their previous high score. It works complete in an SFML executable window and does not require
any command line interface.

Note: The highscores.txt, arial.ttf, coolX.png, coolO.png, and coolBoard.png must all be in the same file as the main.cpp, Game.cpp, and Game.h
